I'm a product oriented engineer, I built with the consumer in mind. With this being the case, I wanted to build both a front-end with a back-end like logic so I chose build in React. Took about 8 hours. Enjoyed every minute of this. Would love to work at Gemini, I put a lot into this project to show I'm passionate about the company –– I truly hope you all find my project decent and worthwhile, I'd love the chance to interview moving forward. If there are any questions I'd be happy to answer them.

Use npm start to start the application. Enter in addresses into the text-field to create an order. Once created, the screen will prompt you to do what you need to do. I assumed the user would have access to Jobcoin Viewer so therefore they could send balances through that, then the Jobcoin mixer would update. However if I had more time, I'd build a means of sending jobcoins on the front-end.

Most of the business logic is in methods.js
Front-end logic is within App.js

Putting business logic on front-end. If I were to improve this, I’d move the logic to a back-end covered with routes.
Have front-end have good animations, better user experience
Create better delays b/w the deposits to various addresses
Better randomization of the addresses portion size
A lot more time on error handling
When using React, compartmentalize my components instead of throwing it all on one big page.
Add loading slider to show that there is a slight delay b/w create order and timeline popping up.
Making event deposit listener better
    - Have more robust system than setInterval
    - Evaluate total amount coming into deposit address ––> ask user how much they want to deposit.
